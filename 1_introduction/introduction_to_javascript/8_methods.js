See MDN web docs for string methods

https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String

Methods can also be called with the dot operator.

We have been using one, console.log()

There are a bunch of built-in methods for every data type.

// Use .toUpperCase() to log 'Codecademy' in all uppercase letters
console.log('Codecademy'.toUpperCase());

// Use a string method to log the following string without whitespace at the beginning and end of it.
console.log('    Remove whitespace   '.trim());
