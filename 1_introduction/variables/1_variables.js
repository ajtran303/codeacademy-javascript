/*
A variable is a "container" for values that are STORED in the computer's memory.

They use a descriptive name like a LABEL so that humans can read what is going on.

Information stored in a variable can be UPDATED, REFERENCED and RETRIEVED.

In JS, there are three keywords used to create variables: var, let and const.
