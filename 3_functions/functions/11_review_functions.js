/* Concepts covered
A function is a reusable block of code that groups together a sequence of statements to perform a specific task.

A parameter is a named variable inside a functionâ€™s block which will be assigned the value of the argument passed in when the function is invoked

Functions must be called to use them

ES6 introduces new ways of handling arbitrary parameters through default parameters which allow us to assign a default value to a parameter in case no argument is passed into the function.

To return a value from a function, we use a return statement.

Functions can also be defined with arrow function notation.

Function definition can be made concise using concise arrow notation.
